# Binary Search Tree
Implement in C++ the given container (ADT) using a given representation and a binary search tree (BST) as a data structure. You are not allowed to use any container or 
data structure from STL or from any other library. Do not implement a separate class for the binary search tree (or for the dynamic array), implement the container directly!
* ADT SortedSet â€“ using a BST with linked representation on an array.
