# CrudProject - Server integration

* Iterate on the DB project to implement the server support.
* All the CRUD operations should retrieve/send from/to a remote server and fall back to the local DB if the Internet connection is down.
* You should be able to demo all CRUD operations, using your own REST server (No cloud services are allowed).
