# Lab 7 - MPI programming

**Due:** week 13

*Goal*

The goal of this lab is to implement a distributed algorithm using MPI.

*Requirement*

Perform the multiplication of 2 polynomials, by distributing computation across several nodes using MPI. Use both the regular O(n2) algorithm and the Karatsuba algorithm.
