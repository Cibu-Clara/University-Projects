Input:  A[] = {5, 0, 10, 6}
        B[] = {1, 2, 4}
Output: prod[] = {5, 10, 30, 26, 52, 24}

The first input array represents "5 + 0x^1 + 10x^2 + 6x^3"
The second array represents "1 + 2x^1 + 4x^2"

And Output is "5 + 10x^1 + 30x^2 + 26x^3 + 52x^4 + 24x^5"


Solution O(n^2) :
  One by one consider every term of the first polynomial and multiply it with every term of
  the second polynomial.

  The time complexity of the above solution is O(m*n). m - the length of the first array, n the length of the second array
  If the size of two polynomials same, then the time complexity is O(n2).

  Each task operates independently on a portion of the result polynomial without sharing data.
  The tasks do not have shared resources that require synchronization.
  The calculations performed by different tasks do not interfere with each other, and they can be executed concurrently
  without synchronization.
