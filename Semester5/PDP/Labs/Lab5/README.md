# Lab 5 - Parallelizing techniques

**Due:** week 10

*Goal*

The goal of this lab is to implement a simple but non-trivial parallel algorithm.

*Requirement*

Perform the multiplication of 2 polynomials. Use both the regular O(n2) algorithm and the Karatsuba algorithm, and each in both the sequencial form and a parallelized form. Compare the 4 variants.

The documentation will describe:

* the algorithms,
* the synchronization used in the parallelized variants,
* the performance measurements
